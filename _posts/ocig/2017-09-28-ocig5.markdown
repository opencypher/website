This was the fifth virtual meeting for members of the openCypher Implementers Group, with the aim of discussing, agreeing upon or rejecting Cypher language changes proposed via Cypher Improvement Requests (<a href="https://github.com/opencypher/openCypher/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3ACIR" target="_blank">CIRs</a>) and Improvement Proposals (<a href="/cips/" target="_blank">CIPs</a>).

The agenda focused on Cypher.PL, an executable specification of Cypher, along with a proposal of how to define and manage versioning in Cypher.
In addition, a way forward was discussed regarding the establishment of common conventions for the structure of the namespace of a (vendor-specific) function or procedure.
