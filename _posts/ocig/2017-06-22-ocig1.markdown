This was the first virtual meeting for members of the openCypher Implementers Group, with the aim of discussing, agreeing upon or rejecting Cypher language changes proposed via Cypher Improvement Requests (<a href="https://github.com/opencypher/openCypher/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3ACIR" target="_blank">CIRs</a>) and Improvement Proposals (<a href="/cips/" target="_blank">CIPs</a>).

## Logistics

The first oCIG meeting was held at 15.00 - 16:30 UTC on Thursday, 22 June 2017.

During the course of the meeting, [this Google document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1hBQGT-3jOIL00Kb8zkPCTwQWIam_YX90SkC3JWyICsI/edit?usp=sharing) was shared between participants for collaborative notes.

## Executive summary

The major outcome was the acceptance by the oCIG of a new clause into Cypher, called [`MANDATORY MATCH`](https://github.com/opencypher/openCypher/pull/212).
This is a new variant of the `MATCH` clause (in effect a sibling of the `OPTIONAL MATCH` clause), which will cause a query to fail if no matching data is found in the underlying graph, and the purpose is to allow for easier query validation.

`MANDATORY MATCH <pattern>` allows the author of a query to force a match in the cases where there is an expectation of matching at least one node complying with `<pattern>`, enabling implicit query validity checking.
Errors in the writing of the query itself -- such as invalid/non-existent parameter values -- will raise an appropriate exception.

`MANDATORY MATCH` confers the following benefits:

* Developers get a powerful new facility for detecting semantic errors in their applications, failing early in the case of an error.
* Unnecessary round-trips to the database in order to check for the presence of mandatory data are avoided, leading to decreased application latency.
* Extra validation code to check for the presence of mandatory data is no longer required, leading to decreased application complexity and verbosity, and increased application maintainability.
* The expectation of a query (insofar as which portions of the data are expected to be present) is made much more obvious from the outset, leading to a better encapsulation of domain knowledge within the query.

Aggregation and grouping was also discussed at the meeting. Currently, the semantics are confusing and ill-defined, leading to unexpected behaviour under some circumstances.
A number of approaches to address this issue were discussed.
Under consideration was a proposed syntactical change allowing for far easier differentiation between aggregating functions (such as `count()`), and standard functions (such as `length()`) to improve query readability.

The `MANDATORY MATCH` clause, as well as the issues and proposed solutions regarding aggregation and grouping, will be discussed in detail in blog posts.
